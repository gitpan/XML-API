    Makefile.PL
        Require Scalar::Util
    
    XML::API
        Fixed the check for _adding an object to itself (and now test that it
        actually works). Scalar::Util::refaddr is handy here.
    
        New _lang and _dir methods for returning the language and text
        direction for the current node.

    XML::API
        Added XML namespace support. Thanks to Dariusz Grabias for discovering
        this missing functionality.

    Bugfix: Content that starts with '-[0-9]' (eg negative numbers) was
    being mistaken as an attribute key/definition.

    Makefile.PL
        Stop CPAN from indexing private packages XML::API::SAXHandler and
        XML::API::Element.
    
    XML::API
        Optimisation: Add the /o compile flag to most regular expressions, and
        convert a few "" into ''.
    
        Properly reimplement _fast_string which got replaced during last major
        refactoring.

    Removed META.yml from git control. Maybe this was somehow related to a
    problem of META.yml being stuck with version 0.14, no matter how many times
    I ran Makefile.PL...

    XML::API
        Bugfix: Removed circular-reference memory leak in XML::API::Element
        which was introduced by the rework in

    General
        Added Test::Exception to the requirements for this module. It appears
        that Perl 5.9.X doesn't have this available by default. Thanks to
        David Cantrell of cpan-testers for reporting.
    
    XML::API
        _parse() adds dummy tags around any text to be fed to the SAX routines
        since what XML::API will accept does not necessarily have to be an XML
        document with a single root node.

    t/*, Makefile.PL, debian/control
        Build depend on Test::Pod[::Coverage] so we actually run the pod tests.
    
    XML::API
        Fixed a bug relating to merging the elements of two different XML::API
        objects.

    General
        Moved syntax tree implementation away from Tree::Simple and into
        XML::API::Element. Resulted in large amount of code reduction and
        complexity:
    
            lib/XML/API.pm | 154 insertions(+), 351 deletions(-)
    
        and also improved the speed considerably for adding elements:
    
            Benchmark: timing 10000 iterations of new, old...
                new:  2 wallclock secs ( 2.04 usr +  0.24 sys =  2.28 CPU)
                      @ 4385.96/s (n=10000)
                old: 10 wallclock secs ( 8.82 usr +  1.06 sys =  9.88 CPU)
                      @ 1012.15/s (n=10000)
    
        The speed difference on any non-trivially sized document is
        almost a factor of 2! Rendering has a similar improvement.
    
    Build.PL
        Removed.
    
    XML::API::Element::Cdata, XML::API::Element::Comment
        Folded into XML::API::Element
    
    Makefile.PL, debian/control
        Removed dependencies on Tree::Simple and libtree-simple-perl.

    * Changed the behaviour of _set_lang to set xml:lang on the next
